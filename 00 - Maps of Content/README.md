# Maps of Content (MOC)

Maps of Content are navigational hub notes that connect related ideas across your vault. They serve as entry points to exploring topics, both technical and non-technical.

## What Goes Here

- **Technical**: Collections linking programming concepts, languages, and frameworks
- **Domain**: Structured knowledge about specific fields or industries
- **Project Overviews**: High-level summaries linking to project materials
- **Area Dashboards**: Central pages for ongoing areas of responsibility
- **Interest**: Collections of resources on personal interests and hobbies

## Software Engineering MOCs to Start With

- **Programming Language**: Create one for each language you use (e.g., `Golang`, `Rust`)
- **Technology Stack**: Organize frameworks, libraries, and tools you work with
- **Computer Science**: Link fundamental concepts and algorithms
- **System Design**: Connect architecture patterns and design principles

## How to Use MOCs

1. Start with work-related MOCs to organize technical knowledge
2. Create new MOCs when you have several related notes on a topic
3. Include links to relevant notes from across your vault
4. Add brief context about why notes are related
5. Group related notes into logical sections
6. Link back to your MOC from individual notes
7. Expand to non-technical interests as your vault grows

## Example MOC Structure

```markdown
# Golang MOC

## Language Fundamentals
- [[Golang - Concurrency Model]]
- [[Golang - Error Handling Patterns]]

## Frameworks & Libraries
- [[Golang - Gin Web Framework]]
- [[Golang - gRPC Implementation]]

## Projects
- [[Project: API Migration to Go]]
- [[Project: CLI Tool Development]]

## Resources
- [[Book: The Go Programming Language]]
- [[Course: Advanced Go Concurrency Patterns]]
```

## Expanding to Other Domains

As your system grows, consider adding MOCs for:
- Personal interests (e.g., `Photography`)
- Life areas (e.g., `Health`, `Personal Finance`)
- Learning topics (e.g., `Language Learning`, `History`)

MOCs help prevent your notes from becoming isolated islands of information and become more valuable as your knowledge spans multiple domains.
