# Inbox

The Inbox is a capture area for new, unprocessed notes. Think of it as your "digital desk" for ideas that haven't been organized yet, both work-related and personal.

## What Goes Here

- **Code Snippets**: Useful pieces of code to reference later
- **Technical Ideas**: Software concepts, architecture thoughts, implementation approaches
- **Meeting Notes**: Initial notes from work meetings or calls
- **Personal Ideas**: Thoughts on non-work topics you want to explore
- **Imported Content**: Articles, highlights, or excerpts to process later
- **Draft Thoughts**: Incomplete ideas that need development
- **Questions & Problems**: Issues you're trying to solve or questions to research

## How to Use the Inbox

1. **Capture without friction**: Don't worry about organization, just get it down
2. **Be specific with technical notes**: Include enough context for technical captures
3. **Process regularly**: Schedule time to review and process inbox items
4. **Move processed notes**: Once processed, move notes to their proper location
5. **Leave breadcrumbs**: When moving notes, consider leaving a redirect note

## Software Engineering Examples

What you might initially capture in your Inbox:
- Error messages and their solutions
- API design ideas
- Meeting notes from sprint planning
- Architecture thoughts that come while coding
- Links to technical articles to read later
- Code snippets that solved tricky problems
- Ideas for future projects or improvements

## Processing Workflow

1. Review inbox notes during your regular review sessions
2. For each note, decide:
   - Is this a fleeting thought? → Move to Fleeting Notes
   - Is this a permanent concept? → Extract to Permanent Notes
   - Is this project-related? → Move to appropriate Project
   - Is this reference material? → Move to Resources
   - Is this no longer needed? → Delete

## Beyond Software Engineering

As you expand your second brain, your Inbox will also collect:
- Personal project ideas
- Book recommendations
- Learning topics to explore
- Health and fitness thoughts
- Travel ideas
- Financial insights

Aim to keep your inbox at zero (or close to it) by processing notes regularly.
