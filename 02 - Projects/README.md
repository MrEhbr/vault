# Projects

Projects are temporary efforts with defined outcomes and deadlines. This folder contains all your active project notes and materials, both professional and personal.

## What Goes Here

- **Software Development Projects**: Application development, API design, refactoring initiatives
- **Technical Documentation**: Architecture diagrams, API specifications, technical designs
- **Learning Projects**: Courses, certifications, structured learning plans
- **Personal Projects**: Home improvement, creative endeavors, hobby projects
- **Meeting Notes**: Notes from project-related meetings
- **Task Lists**: Project-specific tasks and action items
- **Status Updates**: Progress reports and project journals

## Software Engineering Projects to Start With

- **Codebase Refactoring**: Documentation of refactoring efforts
- **Feature Development**: Plans and documentation for new features
- **Technical Migrations**: Plans for moving to new technologies
- **System Architecture**: Design of new systems or components
- **Learning Plans**: Structured approaches to learning new technologies

## How to Organize Projects

1. Create a folder for each active project
2. Start each project with an index note (e.g., "Project: API Refactor")
3. Link project notes to relevant permanent notes and resources
4. Use consistent prefixes for project notes (e.g., "P: API - Design Decisions")
5. Include both technical details and business context for software projects

## Project Note Structure Example

## Expanding Beyond Software Projects

As your system grows, add projects for:
- Home improvements and renovation
- Personal finance initiatives
- Travel planning
- Creative projects (writing, photography, music)
- Health and fitness goals
- Community and volunteer work

When projects are completed, move them to Archives with a summary of key learnings.
