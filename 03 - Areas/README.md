# Areas

Areas are ongoing responsibilities that require maintenance over time. Unlike projects, they have no end date and represent the different domains of your life and career.

## What Goes Here

- **Software Engineering**: Languages, frameworks, and technical domains you maintain
- **Technical Leadership**: Team management, mentoring, code reviews
- **Career Development**: Skills, learning, and growth in your profession
- **Health & Wellness**: Fitness, nutrition, and wellness tracking
- **Finance**: Budget tracking, investment notes, financial planning
- **Relationships**: Family, friends, professional network notes
- **Home**: Home management, maintenance, improvements
- **Hobbies**: Ongoing activities and personal interests

## Software Engineering Areas to Start With

- **Programming Languages**: Areas for each language you work with (Go, Rust, etc.)
- **Development Environments**: IDE setup, terminal configurations, productivity tools
- **System Administration**: Server management, deployment pipelines, infrastructure
- **Professional Development**: Career planning, skill development, certifications
- **Technical Documentation**: Standards, practices, and templates

## How to Organize Areas

1. Create a folder for each major area
2. Start each area with an index note (e.g., "00 - Index")
3. Link area notes to relevant permanent notes, projects, and resources
4. Consider creating dashboards for areas using dataview (if using the plugin)
5. Regularly review and update each area

## Expanding to Other Life Areas

As your system grows, develop areas for non-technical aspects:
- **Health & Fitness**: Exercise routines, nutrition, medical information
- **Personal Finance**: Budgeting, investing, financial planning
- **Home Management**: Maintenance, improvements, documentation
- **Family**: Important information, traditions, planning
- **Travel**: Planning resources, favorite places, travel tips
- **Hobbies**: Materials, techniques, inspiration for personal interests

Areas typically remain active indefinitely but can be archived if no longer relevant.
