# Fleeting Thought - 2023-05-15

Just realized that the way I organize my digital notes is similar to how I organize my physical workspace. 

There seems to be a connection between physical and digital organization systems. Maybe there are principles that apply to both?

Could explore:
- Spatial memory in digital vs physical environments
- Visibility vs hiding information
- Context switching costs

Related to:
- [[Digital Organization]]
- [[Workspace Design]]

TODO: Research if there are studies on this connection

Fleeting notes should be reviewed and processed regularly (weekly or more often) to extract valuable insights into your permanent notes system.
