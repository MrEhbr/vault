# Assets

The Assets folder stores all attachments, images, PDFs, and other files that are used in your notes.

## What Goes Here

- **Images**: Screenshots, diagrams, photos used in notes
- **PDFs**: Documents, papers, reports, and other PDF files
- **Audio Files**: Recordings, interviews, and other audio content
- **Videos**: Video content referenced in your notes
- **Documents**: Word, Excel, or other document formats
- **Downloads**: Files downloaded for reference

## How to Organize Assets

1. **Use subfolder categories**: Consider organizing by type (images, pdfs, etc.)
2. **Name files consistently**: Use descriptive names with dates when appropriate
3. **Link assets to notes**: Always link assets to the notes that reference them
4. **Clean up periodically**: Remove unused assets to save space

## Asset Naming Conventions
