## 1. Daily Development Workflow

### Morning Capture (Technical Focus)

1. Open Obsidian
2. Create today's daily note (in 07 - Daily folder)
   â€¢ Use Daily Notes plugin or manually create YYYY-MM-DD.md
3. Review yesterday's open tasks and carry them forward
4. List today's priorities (meetings, coding tasks, reviews)
5. Open relevant project notes for context

**Example Daily Note Location:**
`07 - Daily/2023-06-15.md`

**Example Daily Note Start:**
```markdown
# Daily Note - 2023-06-15 (Thursday)

## Carry-over Tasks
- [ ] Finish API authentication implementation
- [ ] Review PR from Sarah on database indexing

## Today's Priorities
- [ ] Sprint planning meeting (10:00)
- [ ] Complete user authorization module
- [ ] Debug performance issue in search function
- [ ] Set up monitoring for new service

## Notes & Thoughts
...
```

### During the Day (Capture Mode)

1. When you solve a technical problem:
   - Quickly capture the solution in your daily note (07 - Daily)
   - Include error messages and code snippets
   - Tag with #solution #code

2. During/after meetings:
   - Take notes directly in your daily note (07 - Daily)
   - Mark action items with checkboxes [ ]
   - Tag with #meeting

3. When you encounter a useful concept:
   - Capture in Inbox (01 - Inbox) or Fleeting Notes (06 - Fleeting)
   - Include enough context to process later
   - Add #toprocess tag

**Example In-Day Capture in Daily Note:**
`07 - Daily/2023-06-15.md`

```markdown
## Notes & Thoughts

### JWT Implementation Issue (10:30am)
Error: `Token signature verification failed`
Solution: Had to synchronize server time with NTP
#solution #authentication

### Sprint Planning Notes (11:15am)
- New feature prioritized: Advanced search
- Database migration scheduled for next Tuesday
- My tasks: Finish auth system, help with search performance
- Team concerned about test coverage
- Action Items:
  - [ ] Complete auth system by Friday
  - [ ] Schedule pair programming with Alex on test improvement
#meeting #sprint
```

**Alternative: Quick Capture in Inbox:**
`01 - Inbox/JWT Authentication Issue.md`

### End of Day Processing (15 minutes)

1. Review the day's notes (in 07 - Daily)
2. Complete daily reflection
3. Format and organize any messy notes
4. Create permanent notes for important concepts (in 05 - Permanent)
5. Move project-specific notes to project files (in 02 - Projects)
6. Set tomorrow's preliminary tasks

**Example End-of-Day (in same Daily Note):**
`07 - Daily/2023-06-15.md`

```markdown
## Daily Reflection
- Good progress on auth system
- Learned about JWT token security best practices
- Need to improve meeting focus
- Tomorrow: Focus on completing auth system tests

## For Tomorrow
- [ ] Implement auth system unit tests
- [ ] Pair programming with Alex (2pm)
- [ ] Research monitoring solutions
```

## 2. Extracting Permanent Notes (Weekly Process)

### From Code Solutions to Permanent Notes

1. During weekly review, identify valuable solutions from daily notes (07 - Daily)
2. Create new note in Permanent Notes folder (05 - Permanent) with timestamp ID
3. Extract the core concept (not just the specific solution)
4. Add context and explanation in your own words
5. Link to related concepts
6. Tag appropriately

**Example Source (Daily Note):**
`07 - Daily/2023-06-15.md`

**Example Transformation to Permanent Note:**
`05 - Permanent/20230615-1435 JWT Token Time Sensitivity.md`

```markdown
# 20230615-1435 JWT Token Time Sensitivity

JWT tokens can fail validation when server times are not synchronized, as the token's `iat` (issued at) and `exp` (expiration) fields are time-dependent.

## Problem Signs
- "Token signature verification failed" errors
- Intermittent authentication issues
- Problems across multiple servers but not locally

## Solutions
- Implement NTP time synchronization across all servers
- Add clock skew tolerance in token validation
- Consider using longer token validity periods for non-critical applications

## Code Example

// Add tolerance for clock skew
tokenValidationParams := jwt.ValidationParameters{
    ClockSkew: time.Minute * 5,
    // other parameters
}

## 3. Project Knowledge Management Flow

### Setting Up a New Coding Project

1. Create project folder in Projects directory (02 - Projects/Project Name)
2. Create project index note with metadata
3. Set up standard sections (overview, architecture, decisions)
4. Link to relevant resources and references
5. Create initial task list

**Example Project Setup:**
`02 - Projects/E-commerce API Modernization/E-commerce API Modernization.md`

```markdown
# Project: E-commerce API Modernization

## Overview
- Start date: 2023-06-15
- Target completion: 2023-09-30
- Goal: Replace monolithic API with microservices architecture
- Team: @Alex (Frontend), @Sarah (DB), @Me (Backend)

## Architecture
- Microservices with API gateway
- Event-driven communication
- PostgreSQL for persistence
- Redis for caching
![[ecommerce-architecture-diagram.png]]

## Technical Decisions
- [[Decision Record: Service Boundaries]]
- [[Decision Record: Authentication Approach]]
- [[Decision Record: Database Schema]]

## Development Tasks
- [ ] Define service boundaries
- [ ] Create API gateway
- [ ] Implement auth service
- [ ] Migrate product catalog
- [ ] Implement order processing

## Resources
- [[Book: Building Microservices]]
- [[Internal: Legacy System Documentation]]
- [[Article: API Gateway Patterns]]
```

**Associated Architecture Diagram:**
`98 - Assets/ecommerce-architecture-diagram.png`

### Documenting Technical Decisions

1. When making significant decisions:
   - Create note in project folder (02 - Projects/Project Name/)
   - Document context, options, decision, and rationale
   - Link to relevant permanent notes
   - Link from project index

**Example Decision Record:**
`02 - Projects/E-commerce API Modernization/Decision Record - Authentication Approach.md`

```markdown
# Decision Record: Authentication Approach

## Context
The new microservices architecture requires a centralized authentication system.

## Options Considered
1. **Session-based auth with Redis**
   - Pros: Familiar, easy revocation
   - Cons: State management across services, scaling issues

2. **JWT-based auth**
   - Pros: Stateless, good for microservices
   - Cons: Token size, revocation challenges

3. **OAuth 2.0 with external provider**
   - Pros: Standardized, delegation support
   - Cons: Complexity, external dependency

## Decision
Implement **JWT-based authentication** with a dedicated Auth Service

## Rationale
- Fits well with stateless microservices architecture
- Reduces cross-service communication for auth checks
- Simpler to implement than OAuth initially
- Can migrate to OAuth provider later if needed

## Implementation Notes
- Auth service will issue and validate tokens
- Short expiry with refresh tokens for security
- Use Redis for refresh token storage and revocation
- See [[20230615-1435 JWT Token Time Sensitivity]] for implementation concerns

## Status
Approved - 2023-06-17
```

## 4. Learning Flow - From Resources to Knowledge

### Technical Book Processing

1. Create note in Resources/Books folder (04 - Resources/Books/)
2. Take progressive notes while reading
3. Highlight key concepts, code examples, insights
4. During weekly review:
   - Extract concepts to permanent notes (05 - Permanent)
   - Connect to existing knowledge
   - Update relevant MOCs (00 - Maps of Content)

**Example Book Resource:**
`04 - Resources/Books/Designing Data-Intensive Applications.md`

```markdown
# Book: Designing Data-Intensive Applications

## Chapter 1: Reliable, Scalable, and Maintainable Applications
- Reliability: System works correctly even with faults
- Scalability: Ability to handle growth (load)
- Maintainability: Different people can work on it productively

### Key Points
- Different database systems optimize for different workloads
- Important to understand trade-offs when choosing technologies
- Highlighted concept: "There is no one-size-fits-all solution" (p. 17)

### Concepts to Process
- [ ] #toprocess Load parameters (p. 11)
- [ ] #toprocess Percentiles in performance (p. 14)
- [ ] #toprocess Evolvability in system design (p. 21)
```

**Resulting Permanent Note:**
`05 - Permanent/20230617-1015 Percentiles in Performance Measurement.md`

```markdown
# 20230617-1015 Percentiles in Performance Measurement

Performance metrics based on averages can be misleading because they hide outliers that affect user experience. Percentiles provide a better picture of real-world performance.

## Key Concepts
- **p50** (median): Normal case performance
- **p95**: The long tail starts to show
- **p99**: The worst 1% of cases
- **p999**: The extreme outliers

## Applications
- SLA definitions should use percentiles, not averages
- Monitoring should track percentiles over time
- Optimization should target specific percentiles based on business needs

## Example Calculation

def percentile(values, p):
    """Calculate the pth percentile of values"""
    # Implementation...

## 5. Technical Problem Solving Flow

### Debugging and Solution Workflow

1. When encountering a problem:
   - Document the issue in your Daily Note (07 - Daily)
   - Include error messages, environment details
   - Track approaches tried

2. When finding the solution:
   - Document the solution in the same note
   - Tag with #solution

3. During weekly processing:
   - If it's a common problem, create a permanent note (05 - Permanent)
   - If it's project-specific, move to project notes (02 - Projects)
   - Link to related concepts

**Example Problem Documentation in Daily Note:**
`07 - Daily/2023-06-18.md`

```markdown
### Docker Container Connection Issue (2:15pm)
Problem: Containers can't connect to each other by service name
Error: `Could not resolve host: auth-service`
Environment: Docker Compose, Ubuntu 22.04

Tried:
- Checked network config in docker-compose.yml âœ“
- Verified DNS settings âœ“
- Restarted Docker daemon âœ“

Solution: Network definition was missing in compose file. Added:

networks:
  app-network:
    driver: bridge

And added network references to each service.
#solution #docker
```

**Resulting Permanent Note:**
`05 - Permanent/20230618-1630 Docker Compose Networking Fundamentals.md`

```markdown
# 20230618-1630 Docker Compose Networking Fundamentals

Docker Compose service-to-service communication requires properly configured networks to enable DNS resolution by service name.

## Common Issues
- Services unable to resolve each other by name
- Connection refused errors between services
- Intermittent connectivity between containers

## Networking Essentials
- Each Compose file needs explicit network definition
- Services must reference the same network
- Bridge driver is standard for single-host deployments
- Container names become DNS entries within the network

## Example Configuration

networks:
  app-network:
    driver: bridge

services:
  service1:
    # service config
    networks:
      - app-network
      
  service2:
    # service config
    networks:
      - app-network

## Debugging Approaches
- Use `docker network ls` to verify network creation
- Check service with `docker-compose ps`
- Test resolution with `docker exec <container> ping <service>`
- Verify network assignment with `docker network inspect`
