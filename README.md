# Versatile Second Brain (Starting with Software Engineering)

This vault combines the organizational structure of PARA with the interconnected knowledge approach of Zettelkasten. While initially focused on software engineering, this system is designed to expand to all areas of knowledge and interest over time.

## Folder Structure

- **00 - Maps of Content**: Entry points to your knowledge (e.g., `Rust`, `Golang`, `System Design`, `Personal Finance`)
- **01 - Inbox**: Temporary storage for quick captures (ideas, notes, observations, snippets)
- **02 - Projects**: Active projects with defined outcomes (e.g., `API Refactor`, `Home Renovation`)
- **03 - Areas**: Ongoing responsibilities (e.g., `Software Development`, `Health`, `Learning`)
- **04 - Resources**: Reference materials by topic (e.g., `Programming`, `Books`, `Cooking`, `Travel`)
- **05 - Permanent**: Atomic concept notes on any topic (e.g., `20230515-1042 Effective API Design`)
- **06 - Fleeting**: Quick thoughts for later processing (work-related or personal)
- **07 - Daily**: Daily logs, work notes, and personal journaling
- **08 - Archives**: Completed projects and outdated references
- **98 - Assets**: Diagrams, screenshots, images, PDFs, and other attachments
- **99 - Meta**: Vault configuration, templates, and system notes

## Knowledge Management Workflow (CODEC)

### 1. **Capture** 
Collect knowledge without interrupting your flow:
- Drop ideas, snippets, and insights in **Inbox**
- Record daily activities and thoughts in **Daily Notes**
- Save quick thoughts in **Fleeting Notes**
- Use templates for consistent capture

### 2. **Organize**
Structure your knowledge systematically:
- Move project materials to respective **Project** folders
- Organize ongoing responsibilities into **Areas**
- File reference materials by domain in **Resources**
- Link related content regardless of location

### 3. **Distill**
Extract key principles and patterns:
- Convert experiences into reusable insights in **Permanent Notes**
- Extract concepts from learning materials into atomic notes
- Focus on understanding core principles
- Create your own mental models from what you learn

### 4. **Express**
Create navigational structures:
- Build **Maps of Content** for important domains
- Develop guides and references from your notes
- Create personal standards and principles
- Document decisions and their rationale

### 5. **Connect**
Build your knowledge graph:
- Link problems to solutions
- Connect similar patterns across different domains
- Map concepts to practical applications
- Create unexpected connections between different areas of knowledge

## Starting With Software Engineering

As a software engineer, you might begin with:

- **Daily Notes**: Track your development work, meetings, and debugging sessions
- **Projects**: Document current programming projects, code architecture, and decisions
- **Permanent Notes**: Create atomic notes on technical concepts and patterns
- **Resources**: Reference materials for languages, frameworks, and tools

Then expand to other areas of interest as your system matures.

## Example Expansion Beyond Software

As your system grows, you might add:
- Personal finance tracking in Areas
- Hobby projects in Projects
- Book notes in Resources
- Health tracking in Daily Notes
- Travel planning in Projects
- Recipe collection in Resources

## Progressive Implementation

1. Start with just **Daily Notes** and **Inbox** to build the capture habit
2. Add **Projects** and **Resources** structure as needed
3. Begin creating **Permanent Notes** for important concepts
4. Build **Maps of Content** once you have enough notes to organize
5. Gradually expand to new domains beyond your initial focus

Remember: Your second brain becomes more valuable as you add connections between different areas of knowledge and experience.
