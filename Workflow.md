# Second Brain Workflow

This document outlines the recommended workflow for maintaining your second brain system.

## Daily Workflow

1. **Morning Setup (10-15 min)**
   - Create today's daily note
   - Review yesterday's daily note
   - Plan today's tasks and priorities

2. **Throughout the Day (ongoing)**
   - Capture thoughts, ideas, and information in Daily Note or Inbox
   - Take meeting notes directly in Daily Note
   - Add tasks as they come up

3. **End of Day (5-10 min)**
   - Review the day's notes
   - Complete daily reflection
   - Set preliminary tasks for tomorrow

## Weekly Workflow

1. **Weekly Review (30-60 min, typically on Sunday or Friday)**
   - Process unprocessed notes from Inbox and Daily Notes
   - Update Projects and Areas
   - Extract insights to Permanent Notes
   - Create connections between notes
   - Plan for the coming week

2. **Note Processing Session (30-60 min, mid-week)**
   - Convert Fleeting Notes to Permanent Notes
   - Create or update Maps of Content
   - Develop ideas from insights captured throughout the week

## Monthly Workflow

1. **Monthly Review (1-2 hours)**
   - Review completed Projects
   - Archive completed or inactive materials
   - Update Areas with monthly reflections
   - Review and refine your Maps of Content
   - Consider system improvements

## Note Processing Guidelines

When processing notes, follow this workflow:

1. **Capture**: Get information into your system (Inbox, Daily Notes, Fleeting)
2. **Process**: Decide what to do with each piece of information
   - Is it actionable? → Create task or project
   - Is it a useful concept? → Create permanent note
   - Is it project-specific? → Add to project notes
   - Is it reference material? → Add to resources
   - Not useful? → Delete
3. **Connect**: Link new notes to existing notes
4. **Review**: Regularly revisit and refine your notes

## PARA + Zettelkasten Integration

- Use PARA for organizational structure (Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives)
- Use Zettelkasten for knowledge development (Permanent Notes)
- Connect the two systems through:
  - Links from Projects/Areas to relevant Permanent Notes
  - Maps of Content that bring together related notes
  - Tags that cross-reference across both systems

Following this workflow will help you maintain a useful and organized second brain.
